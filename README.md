✈️ Air‑Line Ticket Booking System (C / C++)

This project is a console‑based airline ticket booking system implemented in C++ (with output binary/executable). It simulates a simple airline booking workflow, letting users manage and book flights, store passenger details, and maintain booking records.

🔹 Features

Add and manage passenger data (e.g. new user registration, storing passenger info in a CSV file).

Book flights — select flights and allocate tickets to passengers.

Store and manage booking records persistently (e.g. using a CSV file like users.csv).

Basic user interface through console/terminal; easy to compile and run.

Lightweight and platform‑agnostic (since it’s built in C++), no heavy dependencies needed.

📁 Project Contents

Source code (Airline‑Ticket‑Booking‑System.cpp) with full booking logic.

Compiled executable and object files (for easy testing/running).

Supporting data file (users.csv) to store passenger/booking information persistently.

README file for instructions and documentation.

✅ Purpose & Use‑Case

The project serves as an educational example of how an airline booking system can be implemented in a low‑level language (C++), demonstrating:

Data handling and file I/O (reading/writing CSV)

User‑driven booking workflow logic

Basic data persistence without databases

Fundamentals of building a booking/reservation system — useful for small-scale or learning environments

🛠️ Good For

Students learning C/C++ and basic data management

Beginners who want to understand how reservation systems work behind the scenes

Anyone who wants a simple command‑line airline booking demo they can compile and run locally
